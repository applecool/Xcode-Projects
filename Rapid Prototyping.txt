What is Rapid Prototyping?
	Quickly fabricate a scale of a workable product.
	Brainstorming with a product.
	Probabling the skill you need to be fantastic at.
	Easily the key to success in software development.

Production thought process:

	Funnel process: Broader ----> Narrower 

	Divergent thinking ---> Rapid Prototyping --> Convergent Thinking

What is Divergent Thinking?

--Divergent thinking means it is the ability to find as many solutions to a problem as possible.
--Opposite of convergent thinking
	-- Only one correct solution.
--Draw unexpected connections
--Associated with creativity, brainstorming,creating art and free writing.

Why is Rapid prototyping important?

	It is like brainstorming only better.
	It gets the creative juices flowing.
	You get to see your idea in action.
	You can test your ideas out right away.
	You can spot bad ideas and find good ideas that you never planned for.

Divergent thinking with software:
	Divergent thinking works great with rapid prototyping.
	In the prototyping stage there is no right answer.
	The R.P. process will lead to new ideas which you hadn't considered.
	The more you prototype the better your software will become.

How to be a divergent thinker?
	Always think about the next project.
	Use every second to come up with ideas.
	Creative thinking is like any other skill you can get better at.
	Just let go and start thinking about new ideas.
	Keep your ideas somewhere.
	Some will be useful and some will not.

Eureka!

	After working with divergent thinking you will have more and more "eureka" moments.
	Give yourself time to rest. Sometimes you will be resting and all of a sudden you have "eureka" moment.
	Rest is really important. Creativity is not like a regular job.

The joy of Creating!
	Have fun with creating, this is fun after all.
	Your mood will show up in your work.
	If you are having fun your designs will be better and they will be more creative and ultimately better to use.
